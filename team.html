                    <h2>Raghav Bansal</h2>
                    <div class="team-title">Founding Partner</div>

                    <p>
                        Raghav is a founding partner at Tesu Law, bringing over 8 years of experience in civil and commercial litigation, high-value contractual disputes, and arbitration. Before establishing Tesu Law, he honed his skills at some of India's most respected law firms, including Parekh & Co. and Trilegal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During his career, Raghav has appeared in several high-profile matters before Constitution Benches of the Supreme Court. His experience includes appearances in landmark cases such as the Sabarimala Temple Review Petition, the challenge to the National Entrance cum Eligibility Test (NEET), the challenge to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016, and the challenge to the RBI circular on stressed assets.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Beyond litigation, Raghav frequently represents startups and investors in debt and equity transactions. He advises businesses on navigating complex regulations and high-stakes negotiations, helping companies structure deals that protect their interests while enabling growth. His ability to see both the legal and commercial dimensions of transactions makes him a trusted advisor to founders and investors alike.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Raghav's practice reflects his belief that effective legal counsel requires understanding not just the law, but the business context in which it operates. He brings this perspective to every engagement, whether arguing before the Supreme Court or negotiating a term sheet.
